    <h1>Introduction to Accounting Fundamentals</h1>

    <p>
        Accounting is the process of recording, summarizing, and reporting the myriad of transactions resulting from business operations over a period of time. It is often called the "language of business."
    </p>

    <h2>The Basic Accounting Equation</h2>

    <p>
        The core principle of double-entry bookkeeping rests on the fundamental accounting equation, which must always remain in balance:
    </p>

    <table border="1">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Assets</th>
                <th>=</th>
                <th>Liabilities</th>
                <th>+</th>
                <th>Equity</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>What the company owns</td>
                <td>&nbsp;</td>
                <td>What the company owes to others</td>
                <td>&nbsp;</td>
                <td>What the company owes to its owners</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Three Major Financial Statements</h2>

    <p>
        Companies generally prepare three primary financial statements to summarize their performance and financial position:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Income Statement</strong>
            <p>Shows a company's financial performance over a specific period (e.g., quarter or year). It calculates Profit or Loss.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Balance Sheet</strong>
            <p>Presents a company's financial position at a specific point in time (like a snapshot). It adheres strictly to the Accounting Equation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Statement of Cash Flows</strong>
            <p>Details how cash moved in and out of the company over a period, categorized by operating, investing, and financing activities.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Account Examples</h2>

    <p>
