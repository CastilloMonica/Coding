        <h1>Computer Applications in Accounting</h1>
        <p> Welcome to the Accounting and Information Systems Department. In an economy driven by the rapid emergence of new technologies, new business models, 
        and business globalization, transacting in capital markets becomes increasingly complex, and the role of accounting increasingly vital. The entityâ€™s management must ensure that its internal structures and 
        controls allow it to deliver timely and accurate information to regulators, its board of directors, and investors about its financial performance. Regulators and standard-setters continually evaluate the degree to which existing 
        accounting standards reliably depict the economic impact of the entities business activities. Investors and other market participants must assess the degree to which the entities financial statements and other disclosed information
        reflect the entities performance and economic risks.
